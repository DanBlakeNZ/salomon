I replicated the homepage of Salomon's New Zealand website as a way to further hone and improve my React, and overall development skills and how I thought about building a website.
<br />
The entire page was built using React components with Redux also being used to manage some of the menu functionality. Additionally, the page is fully responsive and was build with a mobile first approach.
<br />
Some of the key features are:<br />
•	Built using React JSX and incorporates Redux to manage the mobile menu state.<br />
•	Repetitive components are rendered using a combination of the map function and object data sored in separate files.<br />
•	Uses Owl Carousel npm package. This was the first time I have used this package and I had to learn not only how to implement it, but implement it with React.<br />
•	Created the carousel thumbnail tab (seen on desktop) that utilises the callback from the Owl Carousel package.<br />
•	Fully responsive. Built mobile first and expands to larger screen sizes.<br />
•	Uses Enzyme to do some simple tests for the Redux Action Creators and Store.<br />
•	Cloudnary is used to store all images.<br />
•	Bundled using Webpack and deployed on Heroku.<br />
